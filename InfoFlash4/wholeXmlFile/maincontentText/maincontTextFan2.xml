	    范將軍  General Fan {Testy Catcher} 
	    
After Fan dead, he became the deity in Jia Jiang’s group.He always work 
together with Hsieh. They are like the leaders, so their powers are stronger than other deities. 

When Fan and Hsieh are exorcising ghosts, every deity will be arranged in special form and use special dance steps.The basic steps they used is “Toe-out”. Fan’s personality is testy and like busy bees. So, his steps will faster than Hsieh’s steps.

When Fan and Hsieh are dacing(exorcising), they will pause in some special pose.  Fan’s pose is always lower than Hsieh’s pose, because they have complementary personalities. In Taiwanese thoughts, that is a perfect relationship to have complementary personalities.
