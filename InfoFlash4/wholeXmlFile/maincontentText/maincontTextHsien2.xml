	   		謝將軍  General Hsieh {Elegant Catcher} 
After Hsieh dead, he became the deity in Jia Jiang’s group.He always work 
together with Fan. They are like the leaders ,so their powers are stronger than other deities. 

When Hsieh and Fan are exorcising ghosts, every deity will be arranged in special form and use special dance steps.The basic steps they used is “Toe-out”. Hsieh’s personality is elegant and like a graceful crane. So, his steps will slower than Fan’s steps.

When Hsieh and Fan are dacing(exorcising), they will pause in some special pose.  Hsieh’s pose is always higher than Fan’s pose, because they have complementary personalities. In Taiwanese thoughts, that is a perfect relationship to have complementary personalities.
